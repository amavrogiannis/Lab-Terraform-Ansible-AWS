## Ansible - Inventory
### Overview
As you can see the aws_ec2.yml file, is a good example if you want to pull your inventory from your **AWS Account** dynamicly. 

As you can see, the yaml file specifies tags, in order to shorten the list and so the SysAdmin is able to target instances that have the specified tags, and them be able to run the Ansible scripts.
